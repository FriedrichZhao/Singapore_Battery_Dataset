## SingaporeBatteryDataset

In this study, we conducted data collection and prepared an in-house battery-type database. We searched from various sources such as Google Images and online shopping websites with battery images and the image selection is based on different practical settings. Each image is manually labelled as 9 specific battery types and the label is verified by a different researcher before the image is included in the dataset. It is impractical to enumerate all battery types due to technical and cost constraints. In BatSort, we incorporate a comprehensive range of common battery types. The dataset is balanced with about 50 images for each battery type. We consider common battery types in Singapore, including:

1. Duracell (alkaline), 
2. IKEA (alkaline), 
3. Energizer (alkaline), 
4. Energizer (industrial), 
5. Energizer (lithium), 
6. Exell (Ni-MH), 
7. Exell (Ni-CD), 
8. GP (alkaline), 
9. Klarus, 
10. Others.

For those outside this scope, we introduce a general category termed as "Others". A group for miscellaneous other battery types with 50 images is included and they are used in model performance evaluation. Altogether we have âˆ¼500 images. All images undergo data cleaning and pre-processing.
